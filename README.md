# Hokie Class

Hokie Class is a template that extends the popular [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme based on the mod [Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class).

## Getting Started

Getting started with Hokie Class is simple.

1. Create a [new repository based on Hokie Class](https://github.com/future-of-security/hokie-class/generate).
1. Update `_config.yml` and `README.md` with your course information. [Be sure to update the url and baseurl](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/site-url-baseurl/).
1. Configure a [publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow). Your course website is now live!
1. Edit and create `.md` [Markdown files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to add more content pages.

Hokie Class has been used to build the Future of Security [course website](https://future-of-security.github.io/).

## Local development environment

Hokie Class includes the [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) settings that allows you to easily set up a local development environment. You will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed. In VSCode, install the [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
